# VPN Connection

Our VPN feature is an advanced way to connect your DXP Cloud Services to
external services within their own private network. This is especially powerful
when you need to connect things like databases or applications only accessible
inside your company VPN to your DXP Cloud services.

## Connecting to a VPN

To connect your environment to a VPN, go to your environment's *Settings* tab.
Then fill the VPN required fields and click on *Connect VPN*. If you want to
disconnect your service from a VPN, you can click on *Disconnect* button.

## Adding Port Configuration

Once you have connected to a VPN, you can also choose which ports you want to
forward requests. At the same page, click on *Add VPN Port*, then fill all
fields as shown below. Finally, click on *Add Port* to add it. To remove a port,
click the *Actions* button and select *Remove*.
