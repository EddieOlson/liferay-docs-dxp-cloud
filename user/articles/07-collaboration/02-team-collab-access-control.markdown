# Team Collaboration & Access Control

With team collaboration you can better manage collaboration and access to your
environments. Each environment can have unique members involved, and each member
can have a role that matches the access level of their job on the environment.

## Inviting Team Members

Select the *Team* tab on the left side menu of your environment and search for
the email of the team member you want to add. Before sending an invite, you must
also declare a role for that member. These roles change the amount of access
that each member has to your environment. You can manage team members via the
Actions button that appears next to each.

## Team Activities

All environment actions performed by a team member, are recorded on the
activities page. The activities contain the author, or performer of the activity
and the date so you always know who is doing what in your environment.

## Understanding Team Roles

**Admin:** Has full control of the environment and its members. Admins are the
only ones that can enable or disable auto-scaling, restore from a backup, and
add or remove team members.

**Contributor:** Can handle most of the development lifecycle and application
management but cannot manage team members or any other actions that are
exclusive to the Admin role.

**Guest:** Is a view-only access level. They can see what's going on in the
environment but can't perform actions or make changes.
