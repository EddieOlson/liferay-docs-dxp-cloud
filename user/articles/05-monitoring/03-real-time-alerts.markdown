# Real-time Alerts

Receiving alerts about your project status helps you to always be the first to
know of any unexpected behavior. You can manage your alerts by choosing how and
which type you want to receive.

## Alert Preferences

You can configure your alerts by clicking on your profile photo located at the
top-right corner of console page and selecting the *Alerts Preferences* option.
After clicking there, you will be redirected to the alerts preferences page
where you will be able to select how and which kind of alerts you want to
receive.

## Alerts Page

Alerts that are delivered to your Console will be accessible by clicking the
bell icon on the top bar. There, you can filter the alerts by environment and
mark an alert as read when you are finished with it.

## Triggering Alerts

All the alerts are triggered by a specific event. If this event is still
happening, the alert status will declare that its *Ongoing*. If it is finished,
it will say *Resolved* and then tell you when the alert started and how long it
endured.
